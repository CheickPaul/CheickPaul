## Long-Term Academic & Professional Project

Thank you for visiting my profil.

This repository is a long-term academic and professional project.

It began as a structured preparation for graduate studies in Finance and Wealth Management. It is intentionally designed as a continuous process rather than a finished product.

Financial markets evolve. Economic conditions shift. Investment frameworks adapt.
For this reason, learning must remain ongoing.

This repository reflects a disciplined commitment to continuous development and intellectual consistency. 
This GitHub is my way of documenting that journey, building and connecting with like minded individuals.


##  About Me 

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Physics and an MBA in Supply Chain and Purchasing.

I am transitioning toward financial markets with a focus on Equity Research, portfolio management, macroeconomic analysis, fixed income, and risk management.

My scientific background shapes my approach to finance: Analytical rigor ; Quantitative reasoning ; Structured thinking ; Long-term perspective

## Purpose

This GitHub serves as a structured archive of my progression.

It includes: Selected financial certifications notes (e.g., Bloomberg Market Concepts, Yale Financial Market, Executive Program of Algorithmic Trading, EPAT, Quantinsti- in progress)

The objective is clarity, coherence, and disciplined thinking over time.

## Long-Term Commitment

This project will continue: Prior to graduate studies, during my master’s program, throughout my professional career

It is intended as a living archive, documenting the evolution of my understanding as I develop academically and professionally.

If these materials provide clarity or support to others interested in finance, then the project fulfills an additional purpose beyond personal development.
