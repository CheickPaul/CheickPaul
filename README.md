## Hi there 👋

This repository documents my self study journey to pursue a role as a junior quant trader and to prepare for a top tier master's degree in Quantitatif / financial market.

## 👤 About Me 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm deeply passionate about financial markets, particularly trading and quantitative finance. Coming from a physics background, I am exploring how mathematical models and programming can be applied to financial decision making and strategies.

After discovering trading through training and seminars, I validated challenges with prop firms such as TOPSTEP. Now I am actively preparing to apply for top tier master's programs in Quantitative finance and seeking opportunities in trading junior roles and quant positions.

This GitHub is my way of documenting that journey, building projects, and connecting with like minded individuals.

## 📈 Algorithmic Trading System for Ultra Bond (UB) under development

This project aims to develop a high performance trading algorithm designed for the Ultra Bond (UB) futures market. The strategy is based on : Institutional accumulation zone, Liquidity sweep (stop runs), Imbalance,
Swing structure break, volume spikes, time-based execution windows, and economic news filtering, basic elements that I have already used for passing a rigorous propfirm challenge. 

The core innovation lies in the integration of multiple AI agents, each responsible for replicating key elements of discretionary trading. The goal is to progressively evolve the system from a semi automated assistant to a fully autonomous algorithm.

This repository documents the design, architecture, agent roles, and the logic of the system. The algorithm is under active development and will be refined in progressive stages.
