## Hi everyone, and thanks for visiting my profile

This repository documents my self study journey to pursue a role as a junior quantitative trader and to prepare for a master's degree in Quantitative finance / finance.

##  About Me 

Welcome to my GitHub profile ! I'm a former Construction entrepreuneur with a academic background in physics, now transitioning into quantitative finance. My current goal is to pursue graduate studies in Quantitative Finance at a master level and work in financial market. I am passionate about trading and quant research and I am exploring how mathematical models and programming can be applied to financial decision making and strategies design.

This GitHub is my way of documenting that journey, building projects, and connecting with like minded individuals.

## Objective

My goal is to review and strengthen my foundations in mathematics and programming (and selected finance topics) with a focus on the skills needed for a career in quantitative trading.
