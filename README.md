## Hi there 👋

This repository documents my self-study journey to to pursue a role as a junior quant trader and to prepare for a top-tier master's degree in financial market.

## 👤 About Me 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm deeply passionate about financial markets, particularly trading and quantitative finance. Coming from a physics background, I am exploring how mathematical models and programming can be applied to financial decision-making and strategies.

After discovering trading through training and seminars, I validated challenges with prop firms such as Topstep. Now I am actively preparing to apply for top-tier master's programs in financial market and seeking opportunities in trading junior roles and quant positions.

This GitHub is my way of documenting that journey, building projects, and connecting with like-minded individuals.
